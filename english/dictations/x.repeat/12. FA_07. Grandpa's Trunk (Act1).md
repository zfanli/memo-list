E: Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?

M: Coffee, please.

E: I'm so excited. At this time tomorrow morning, Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

M: When does he arrival?

E: At six o'clock this evening.

M: By plane?

E: No, by train.

M: Are me picking him at the station?

E: Not Grandpa. He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

M: He likes to be independent.

E: Let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

M: Great! Let's do it.

R: Good morning, mom.

RO: Morning.

E: Well, hi, fellas! Mua!

E: Mua!

R: Hello! Mua!

M: Hello, honey! Mua!

RO: Morning, Marilyn.

M: We're going to upstairs and set up Grandpa's room.

M: There's coffee ready.

RO: I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

R: Me, too. Eh, Milk, please.

RO: He's so funny. He always makes me laugh.

RO: I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

R: I think he will. It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

RO: Won't he miss being Florida?

R: Oh, he will. But I think he'll like being here with the family.

RO: Are you sure about that? It's crazy here most the time.

R: But it's fun.

RO: That's for sure.

R: You know, maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa as a "welcome" present.

RO: That's a neat idea. What can I do?

RO: I've got it. I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet. It's from the Father and Son' Breakfast at my junior hight school graduation.

R: Oh, I remember this picture.

RO: I really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

R: Railroad stations or airports, Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

RO: He's something!

M: Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

E: That's it.

E: But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

M: What's inside?

E: I don't know. It's locked.

P: Hi!

E: Hi! Darling!

M: Good morning, Phillip.

P: I want put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet?

P: You know? I'm very excited about his arrival!

E: We're, too. Susan called early this morning. She's unhappy because she has to go to Chicago on a business strip and can't leave till tonight. She wants to be here for Grandpa.

P: Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too. He loves Susan. She always reminds him Grandma.

P: Well, how's everything here?

M: Fine, we were just wondering about this trunk.

E: It's locked.

P: Oh, I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me!
