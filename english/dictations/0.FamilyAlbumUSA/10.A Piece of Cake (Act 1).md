M: Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

R: Why advanced?

M: My instructor thought that beginner's class **~~is~~ was** too easy for me.

R: So?

M: The advanced class is nonstop.

R: I lift **~~weight~~ weights** every morning for sixty minutes without stopping.

R: No problem.

M: Listen, Richard. Doing aerobics for an hour is a lot **~~difference to~~ different than** lifting **~~weight~~ weights**.

R: Of course. Easy. No sweat.

M: You're not going to be able to move after this and the aerobics class.

R: Are you kidding me? It's going to be a piece of cake!

R: You want **~~a~~ to** bet?

M: Yeah, what's the bet?

R: I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing!

M: The bet is, **~~if~~** I win, **and** you cook dinner for the entire family, or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

R: It's a bet.
