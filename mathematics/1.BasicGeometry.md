## geometry

### lines & angles

- point
- line / linear (1-dimension)
- plane / planar (2-dimensions)
- space (3-dimensions)
- line segment / ray / lne
- collinear (points that on the same line)
- perpendicular lines (two lines intersect at 90 degrees)
- parallel lines (two lines never intersect)
- intersect lines
- plane segment
- vertex
- angle
- acute angle (angles less then 90 degrees)
- obtuse angle (angles greater than 90 degrees)
- right angle (90 degrees angle)
- complementary angles (two angles with a sum of 90 degrees)
- supplementary angles (two angles with a sum of 180 degrees)
- straight angles (an angle measures 180 degrees)
- vertical angles (opposite angles)
- adjacent angles (two angles shared a side)
- transversal (a line intersect with two parallel lines)
- corresponding angles (the angles a transversal intersects with the first line of the parallel lines are equal to the angles that in the same position of the second line)

### Polygons

- triangle
  - scalene triangle (none of the sides is the same length)
  - isosceles triangle (at least the two sides are the same length)
  - equilateral triangle or congruent triangle (three sides are the same length)
  - acute triangle (all of the angles are less than 90 degrees)
  - right triangle (one of the angles is equal to 90 degrees)
  - obtuse triangle (one of the angles is more than 90 degrees)
- quadrilateral (convex, interior angle less than 180 degrees)
  - parallelogram
  - rectangle
  - square
  - trapezoid
  - isosceles trapezoid (a trapezoid that each two opposite sides have the same length)
  - rhombus
- quadrilateral (concave, interior angel larger than 180 degrees)
- pentagon
- hexagon
- heptagon
- octagon

### oval

- circle
- oval
