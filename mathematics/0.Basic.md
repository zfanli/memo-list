## counting factors and calculating GCF & LCM

For a single number, using prime factorization, you can count factors by add 1 to each exponent and multiply.

For more than one number, using prime factorization, you can get the LCM by multiply the factors with the biggest exponent, or get the GCF by multiply the factors with the smallest exponent.

## divisibility rules

- \# by 2, if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
- \# by 3, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
- \# by 4, if its last two digits is divisible by 4.
- \# by 5, if its last digit is 0 or 5.
- \# by 6, if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3.
- \# by 7, a little complicated. Double the last digit and remove it from the number, subtract the doubled result from the remaining number and check is it divisible by 7, if the number is still too big, then repeat the process.
- \# by 8, if its last three digits is divisible by 8.
- \# by 9, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
- \# by 10, if its last digit is 0.
