### Sound change rules

Rules for pronouncing words.

Eg, "낮", "ㄴ + ㅏ + ㅈ", but pronounce as `"낟"`.

**#1 Base consonants**

If those consonants appear in the last, they should be pronounced as `"ㄷ"`.

[ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㄷ, ㅌ, ㅎ]

Eg:

- 갓 -> `"갇"`
- 낳 -> `"낟"`
- 못 -> `"몯"`
- 밭 -> `"받"`
- 있 -> `"읻"`
- 맟 -> `"맏"`

**#2 ㅋ and ㅍ**

These two consonants using as the last consonants, will be pronounced as their normal version `"ㄱ"` and `"ㅂ"`.

Eg:

- 부엌 -> `"부억"`
- 앞 -> `"압"`

**#3 ㅁ, ㄴ, ㅇ, ㄹ**

Pronounce normally if one of them appears in the last syllable.

Eg:

- 간 kan
- 옴 oon
- 방 pang
- 말 mal

**#4 base consonants**

If the first syllable end with a consonant and the next syllable starts with the base consonant, the base consonant then will be pronounced as double consonant.

Base consonants: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ.

Eg:

- 학교 -> `"학꾜"`
- 박자 -> `"박짜"`

**#5 base consonant + `ㅎ` and `ㅎ` + base consonant**

First, base consonant + `ㅎ`, the `ㅎ` will not be pronounced and the base consonant will be blended with the next vowel and turn to strong consonant.

Second, `ㅎ` + base consonant, then the base consonant will be turned to strong consonant, too.

Eg:

- 작하다 ->`"자카다"`
- 벡호 -> `"베코"`
- 괜잖다 -> `"괜잔타"`
- 못하다 -> `"모타다"` (못 -> 몯)

**#6 ㅌ, ㄷ blending with 이, 히**

- ㅌ + 이 = 지
- ㄷ + 히 = 지
- ㄷ + 이 = 시

Eg:

- 같이 -> `"가지"`
- 갇히다 -> `"가지다"`
- 맏이 -> `"마시"`
