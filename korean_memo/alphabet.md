### Sound change rules

Rules for pronouncing words.

Eg, "낮", "ㄴ + ㅏ + ㅈ", but pronounce as `"낟"`.

**#1 base consonants**

If those consonants appear in the last, they should be pronounced as `"ㄷ"`.

[ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㄷ, ㅌ, ㅎ]

Eg:

- 갓 -> `"갇"`
- 낳 -> `"낟"`
- 못 -> `"몯"`
- 밭 -> `"받"`
- 있 -> `"읻"`
- 맟 -> `"맏"`

**#2 ㅋ and ㅍ**

These two consonants using as the last consonants, will be pronounced as their normal version `"ㄱ"` and `"ㅂ"`.

Eg:

- 부엌 -> `"부억"`
- 앞 -> `"압"`

**#3 ㅁ, ㄴ, ㅇ, ㄹ**

Pronounce normally if one of them appears in the last syllable.

Eg:

- 간 kan
- 옴 oon
- 방 pang
- 말 mal

**#4 base consonants**

If the first syllable end with a consonant and the next syllable starts with the base consonant, the base consonant then will be pronounced as double consonant.

Base consonants: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ.

Eg:

- 학교 -> `"학꾜"`
- 박자 -> `"박짜"`

**#5 base consonant + `ㅎ` and `ㅎ` + base consonant**

First, base consonant + `ㅎ`, the `ㅎ` will not be pronounced and the base consonant will be blended with the next vowel and turn to strong consonant.

Second, `ㅎ` + base consonant, then the base consonant will be turned to strong consonant, too.

Eg:

- 작하다 ->`"자카다"`
- 벡호 -> `"베코"`
- 괜잖다 -> `"괜잔타"`
- 못하다 -> `"모타다"` (못 -> 몯)

**#6 ㅌ, ㄷ blending with 이, 히**

- ㅌ + 이 = 지
- ㄷ + 히 = 지
- ㄷ + 이 = 시

Eg:

- 같이 -> `"가지"`
- 갇히다 -> `"가지다"`
- 맏이 -> `"마시"`

**#7 ㄹ + base consonants**

The next consonants will become double consonants.

Eg:

- 알바 -> `"알빠"`
- 웰빙 -> `"웰삥"`
- 얼굴 -> `"얼꿀"`

**#8 ㅂ/ㅍ + ㄴ/ㅁ**

If `ㅂ/ㅍ` are followed by the "nasal" consonants `ㄴ/ㅁ` then they will become `ㅁ`.

Eg:

- 합니다 ->`"함니다"`
- 잡는 -> `"잠는"`
- 합먹자 -> `"함먹짜"`
- 입무 -> `"임무"`

**#9 ㅅ + ㅣ/ㅑ/ㅕ/ㅒ/ㅖ/ㅛ/ㅠ**

The consonant `ㅅ` comes with vowels `ㅣ/ㅑ/ㅕ/ㅒ/ㅖ/ㅛ/ㅠ` will pronounces as `sh`.

Eg:

- 시 -> `shi`

**#10 ㅂ + ㄹ**

The consonants `ㅂ` + `ㄹ` become `ㅁ` + `ㄴ`.

Eg:

- 합리 -> `"함니"`

**#11 ㄱ + ㄹ**

The consonants `ㄱ` + `ㄹ` become `ㅇ` + `ㄴ`.

Eg:

- 백리 -> `"뱅니"`
- 식량 -> `"싱냥"`
- 막료 -> `"망뇨"`

**#12 ㄱ/ㄲ/ㅋ + ㄴ/ㅁ**

If the consonants `ㄱ/ㄲ/ㅋ` come with `ㄴ/ㅁ` then they will turn to `ㅇ`, just like the rule #11.

Eg:

- 한국말 ->`"한궁말"`
- 볶나 ->`"봉나"`
- 부엌문 ->`"부엉문"`

**#13 ㅇ/ㅁ + ㄹ**

If `ㄹ` comes after `ㅇ/ㅁ`, it then will be turned to `ㄴ`, just like `ㄹ` in rules #10 and #11.

Eg:

- 음료 ->`"음뇨"`
- 강릉 ->`"강능"`

**#14 consonant + ㄴ**

If there is no other rule can be apply, then the consonant before `ㄴ` will turns into `ㄴ`.

Eg:

- 빚나 ->`"빈나"`
- 맛나 ->`"만나"`

**#15 ㄹ + ㄴ or ㄴ + ㄹ**

If `ㄴ` combines with `ㄹ`, it will be turned to `ㄹ`.

Eg:

- 혼란 ->`"홀란"`
- 반로 ->`"발로"`

**#16 irregulars**

Some words simple won't obey these rules above.

Eg:

- 십육 ->`"심뉵"`
- 캣잎 ->`"캔닢"`
- 한자 ->`"한까"`
